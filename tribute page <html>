                <h2>Life and Achievements</h2>
                
                <h3>Early Life and Education</h3>
                <p>Marie Skłodowska Curie (1867-1934) was born in Warsaw, Poland. Despite facing numerous obstacles as a woman in science, she pursued her education at the University of Paris, where she met her future husband, Pierre Curie.</p>
                
                <h3>Scientific Discoveries</h3>
                <p>Marie Curie's groundbreaking research revolutionized our understanding of radioactivity. Her major achievements include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1898:</strong> Discovery of the elements polonium and radium</li>
                    <li><strong>1903:</strong> Awarded Nobel Prize in Physics (shared with Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel)</li>
                    <li><strong>1911:</strong> Awarded Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her work on radioactivity</li>
                    <li>Development of mobile X-ray units during World War I</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Legacy and Impact</h3>
                <p>Marie Curie remains the only person to win Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields. Her work laid the foundation for modern nuclear physics and cancer treatments. She established the Curie Institutes in Paris and Warsaw, which remain major centers of medical research today.</p>
